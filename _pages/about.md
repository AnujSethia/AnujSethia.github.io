Hi! 
I am a senior undergraduate pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Physics at the IIT Bombay. I feel attached to the latter, and my research interests lie in the field of Quantum Information science and Quantum control. Currently, I am working with Prof. Sai Vinjanampathy on controlling quantum systems. <br/>

My Physics minor has led to my research interests mentioned above. Following up with the elementary Quantum Mechanics in my first semester, I later studied Quantum Mechanics II, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Optics, Quantum Information, and Computing as well as Physics of Quantum Devices. <br/>

I had actively participated in research on multiple topics in Mechanical Engineering like Cryogyenics, Pool Boiling, and Nonlinear dynamics of soft materials. <br/>
