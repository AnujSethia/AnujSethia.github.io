Hola!

My name is Anuj Sethia. I graduated from **IIT Bombay** in 2020, receiving a BTech in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Engineering Physics. My research interests lie in the field of **Quantum Information Theory** and its applications like **Quantum control, Quantum Cryptogrphy**. <br/>

I am passionate and devoted to delve into these topics. I firmly believe that the next human revolution would be driven by Quantum Technologies and is anticipated soon. <br/>

Apart from Quantum, I had also actively participated in research on topics related to Mechanical Engineering like Cryogyenics, Bubble Dynamics, and Non Linear dynamics of soft materials. <br/>

Keeping aside research, I love reading, traveling and listening to music (or any combination of three, XD). Some of my favorite reading topics are: Philosophy of Science, Sociology and Politics. Coming to music, I have a great fondness to 60s music mostly, Bob Dylana and The Beatles. Last but not least I have recently developed passion for skiing and would love to pursue it further. <br/>
