My current research interests broadly lie in **Quantum Information Theory**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.


Research Projects:
===
1.  **Quantum Optimal Control** (Jan ’20 - ) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Sai Vinjanampathy, Physics Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>



2. **Nucleated Bubble Model** (Nov ’17 - Dec ’18) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Janani Srree Murallidharan, Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay* <br/>

    **Introduction**: We studied boiling heat transfer for industrial systems like Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) in which safety crisis related events, such as the ‘Critical Heat Flux’ occurs frequently. The near-wall vapour dynamics which trigger CHF was studied for designing safe and efficient systems.<br/>

    * - Studied bubble growth and departure dynamics (including lift-off) in two-phase flows, and in boiling heat transfer phenomena for both pool and flow boiling conditions.*<br/>
    * - Performed an assessment of the prediction capabilities of existing bubble departure models.*<br/>
    * - Developed a more accurate mechanistic bubble growth and departure diameter model with
increased capability for low sub-cooling conditions upto 60 K.*<br/>
    * - Studied the applicability of the bubble growth models for operating conditions pertaining to boiling
crisis in nuclear reactors i.e. critical heat flux prediction in PWR’s.*<br/>

3.  **Non-linear Dynamics of elastic materials** (May ’19 - July ’19) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Qu Shaoxing, chool of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhejiang University* <br/>

    **Introduction**: Soft materials like gelatin and hydrogel are usually used to simulate the complex response of various human tissues under multiple loading conditions. These materials follow nonlinear dynamics, such as viscoelasticity, hyperelasticity, or hyper-viscoelasticity.<br/>

    * - Devised a Matlab model for detection of cavitation size in the gelatin filled cuvette to extract diameter.*<br/>
    * - Experimented gelatin and hydrogel under various impact conditions to investigate the effect of cavitation nuclei on cavitation in tissue similar soft material.*<br/>
    * - Studied the behavior of gelatin under drop hammer impact load and devised constitutive model based on Neo-Hookean hyperelasticity to analyse dependancy of various parameters.*<br/>
    * - Reviewed several hyperelastic constitutive models for brain tissues for predicting response of tissues under blast and blunt impact conditions.*<br/>
