My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.

1.  **Strategic Interaction on Networks with Imperfect Substitutability | Master's Thesis** (June '18 - Present) <br/>
    *Guide : [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/), Systems & Control Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    *Introduction*: We study a public goods game on networks with imperfect substitutability, wherein each node is an agent and the action performed is the effort put in the game. The benefit function of each player is dependent on the sum of their own effort and a substitutability factor times the sum of effort of each of their neighbours. The cost is dependent on only one's own effort.
    * Proved that the Nash equilibria of a public goods game on a network are given by suitably scaled solutions to a Linear Complementarity Problem defined using the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph.<br/>
    * Characterized the effort maximizing solutions of public goods game using special structures on the graph which are generalizations of independent sets.<br/>
    * Derived absolute upper bounds for the aggregate effort of any equilibria when the underlying graphs are trees.<br/>
