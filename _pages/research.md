My current research interests broadly lie in **Quantum Information Theory**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.


Research Projects:
===
1.  **Quantum Optimal Control** (Jan ’20 - ) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Sai Vinjanampathy, Physics Department, IIT Bombay* <br/>



2. **Nucleated Bubble Model** (Nov ’17 - Dec ’18) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Janani Srree Murallidharan, Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay* <br/>

    **Introduction**: We studied boiling heat transfer for industrial systems like Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) in which safety crisis related events, such as the ‘Critical Heat Flux’ occurs frequently. The near-wall vapour dynamics which trigger CHF was studied for designing safe and efficient systems.<br/>

    * Studied bubble growth and departure dynamics (including lift-off) in two-phase flows, and in boiling heat transfer phenomena for both pool and flow boiling conditions. <br/>
    * Performed an assessment of the prediction capabilities of existing bubble departure models. <br/>
    * Developed a more accurate mechanistic bubble growth and departure diameter model with increased capability for low sub-cooling conditions upto 60 K. <br/>
    * Studied the applicability of the bubble growth models for operating conditions pertaining to boiling crisis in nuclear reactors i.e. critical heat flux prediction in PWR’s. <br/>

3.  **Non-linear Dynamics of elastic materials** (May ’19 - July ’19) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Qu Shaoxing, chool of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhejiang University* <br/>

    **Introduction**: Soft materials like gelatin and hydrogel are usually used to simulate the complex response of various human tissues under multiple loading conditions. These materials follow nonlinear dynamics, such as viscoelasticity, hyperelasticity, or hyper-viscoelasticity.<br/>

    * Devised a Matlab model for detection of cavitation size in the gelatin filled cuvette to extract diameter. <br/>
    * Experimented gelatin and hydrogel under various impact conditions to investigate the effect of cavitation nuclei on cavitation in tissue similar soft material. <br/>
    * Studied the behavior of gelatin under drop hammer impact load and devised constitutive model based on Neo-Hookean hyperelasticity to analyse dependancy of various parameters. <br/>
    * Reviewed several hyperelastic constitutive models for brain tissues for predicting response of tissues under blast and blunt impact conditions. <br/>

4.	**Sloshing in Liquid Nitrogen** (May ’18 - Jul ’18) 
	*Guide: Prof. Milind D. Atrey, Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay* <br/>

	**Introduction**: Sloshing refers to the free surface movement of a fluid inside a container. Sloshing in cryogens like LN2 and LOx produces boil-off, eventually leading to loss of cryogen. Sloshing is studied to design tank by adding baffles to reduce loss in transit.

	* Studied (2-D) liquid sloshing phenomena in a moving tank subjected to various accelerations and discovered its dependencies on parameters like density, viscosity, amount of liquid. <br/>
	* Compared numerical methods and simulation software which are optimum to study two-phase flow and free surface phenomenon for closed and ambient environment. <br/>
	* Developed a numerical model based on VOF method on ANSYS Fluent to capture free surfacing and validated it with the experimental work already existing in the literature. <br/>
	* Investigated the applicability of sloshing in areas like spacecraft’s fuel tanks, tanks subjected to oceanic motion, oceanographic and other engineering situations of free fluid surface. <br/>
