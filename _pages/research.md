My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.


Research Projects:
===
1.  **Nucleated Bubble Model** (Nov ’17 - Dec ’18) <br/>
    *Guide : Prof. Janani Srree Murallidharan, Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay* <br/>
    **Introduction**: .<br/>
    *>Studied bubble growth and departure dynamics (including lift-off) in two-phase flows, and in boiling heat transfer phenomena for both pool and flow boiling conditions.*<br/>
    *>Performed an assessment of the prediction capabilities of existing bubble departure models.*<br/>
    *>Developed a more accurate mechanistic bubble growth and departure diameter model with
increased capability for low sub-cooling conditions upto 60 K.*<br/>
    *>Studied the applicability of the bubble growth models for operating conditions pertaining to boiling
crisis in nuclear reactors i.e. critical heat flux prediction in PWR’s.*<br/>
    *>Presented the work in 7th International and 45th National Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power
(FMFP-2018) conference.*<br/>
