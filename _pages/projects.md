I have outlined my non-research projects(hobbie projects) in this page.
Technical Projects:
===
1.  **Dilution refrigerator** (Jan ’19 - Apr '19) <br/>
    *Guide: Prof. Milind D. Atrey, ME420 Course Project, IIT Bombay* <br/>

    * Reproduced perfect continuous counter flow heat exchanger models existing in the literature to study the performance of dilution refrigerator and its various dependencies. <br/>
    * Analyzed the effect of Kapitza resistance between solid-liquid, mixing temperature and effective surface area of the heat exchanger on the cooling power and studied the heat leaks. <br/>
    * Developed models and compared them with experimental data available in the literature for varying circulation rates and surface area. <br/>
 

2.  **SeDriCa: Self Driving Car** (Oct ’17 - Mar ’18) <br/>
    *Unmesh Mashruwal Innovation Cell, IIT Bombay* <br/>

    * Developing the first autonomous driving car suitable for Indian roads and conditions to compete in the 3-Staged Mahindra Rise Driverless Car Challenge for a prize of $1 Million. <br/>
    * Programmed and tested modules for instantaneous speed bumper and zebra-crossing detection through image processing using OpenCV libraries. <br/>
    * Attempted to enhance speed bumper detection using Machine Learning based on Indian roads with a combination of a synthetic and natural dataset of over 5000+ images. <br/>
